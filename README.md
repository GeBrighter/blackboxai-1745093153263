# Message App

A simple full-stack message application built using Node.js and Express. This application allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.

## Project Overview

The Message App is a minimalistic messaging application that lets users post messages with a username and text. It utilizes a RESTful API to handle message retrieval and posting, making it suitable for any front-end framework or vanilla JavaScript implementation.

   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash

     - Retrieves all messages.
     - **Response:** JSON array of messages.

   - **POST /api/messages**
     - Post a new message.
     - **Request Body:** 
       ```json
       {
         "username": "your_username",
         "text": "your_message"
       }
       ```
     - **Response:** The newly created message along with its ID and timestamp.

## Features

- Simple RESTful API for managing messages.
- Ability to post messages with a username.
- Real-time message retrieval.
- CORS enabled for cross-domain requests.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following npm packages:

- **express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **cors**: A middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Below is the relevant section from the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "cors": "^2.8.5"
}
```

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
message-app/
├── package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json     # Lockfile for dependencies
├── server.js             # Main server file
└── public/               # Static files (if any)
```

This structure provides a clean organization for the back-end of the application, keeping package management and the server code straightforward.

## Conclusion

The Message App serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to explore full-stack development using Node.js and Express. You can easily extend its functionality by integrating a front-end framework or adding further features to the existing API.
